# PerfumeData
In this project I used a data base that includes name, description, notes and image of more than 2000 perfumes to build a perfume evaluation system. 

The database can you find it over <https://www.kaggle.com/nandini1999/perfume-recommendation-dataset>

It contains two version: Python and R.

There are three parts in this project:

1. Data Clean and Word Frequency Count

2. String matching 

3. LDA and emotional analysis

For Projects in R, please go to PerfumeData/R. I dumped both rmd files and knitted HTMLS in the repo. 

For Projects in Python, please go to PerfumeData/Python. There's a jupyter notebook file. I also upload it on my Google Colab:<https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OFxqTxruJoGZp6c22hrT6caxH2JrOM8Y?usp=sharing>

## Some highlights of my research: 

* Musk,sandalwood, vanilla, patchouli, jasmine, bergamot and amber are among the most used ingredients in my perfume data list. 

* With string macthing, I created my own perfume formulas based on the exsisting perfume formulas in the data base. 

  * My perfume is called : **Zesty While** 
  
   * **Zesty White's formula: Bergamot, Jasmine, Rose, Musk, Incense, Ylang-ylang, Tuberose, Pepper, Labdanum, Lily, Benzoin**
   
* After Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis, I worked out 8 notes and their corresponding projections from the database.
